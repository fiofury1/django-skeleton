# 'templates/registration/' #

This folder includes HTML templates for the urls/views of the Django 'auth' app (i.e. 'django.contrib.auth').

As a reminder, Django provides the routes and views that use these templates.  The views 
are setup by Django to look for the templates in a folder called 'templates/registration'.  

The templates provided here are needed because either Django does not provide the template 
by default OR because the template was rewritten as the the Django provided template uses the Admin site styling.
